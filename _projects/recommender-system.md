The development of the internet and technology has caused a huge increase in data that has become untenable for 
the user. Solving this information overflow has become a main motivation for creating recommender systems. Recommender 
systems make user's decision-making easier by replacing user's information discovery process. Recommender will suggest 
a personalized recommendation based on behavior and personality, resulting in items that could be interesting to the 
user. This recommendation reduces a large amount of data that is irrelevant to the user.
